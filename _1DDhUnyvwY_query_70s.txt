At the timestamp of 70.5s, the video shows a chimpanzee in a tree. The chimpanzee appears to be engaging in some form of expressive behavior, possibly vocalizing or gesturing with its arms. The captions mention "large and lustrous eyes" and "serene self," which could be describing the chimpanzee's appearance and demeanor. There are no other animals visible in the scene at this specific timestamp. However, later in the sequence, there is a shot of a mother chimpanzee with her baby on the ground, but this is not within the specified timestamp.
